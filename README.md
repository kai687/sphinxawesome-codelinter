The **awesome codelinter** extension for the
[Sphinx documentation generator](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) lets you check that code
blocks are valid or follow a preferred style. The extension lets you run an external
tool, such as a linter, over all code blocks in your Sphinx documentation.

## Install

Install the extension:

```console
pip install sphinxawesome-codelinter
```

This Sphinx extension works with Python versions newer than 3.8 and recent Sphinx
releases.

## Configure

To enable this extension in Sphinx, add it to the list of extensions in the Sphinx
configuration file `conf.py`:

```python
extensions = ["sphinxawesome.codelinter"]
```

To use an external tool to check code blocks, add the language and tool as key-value
pairs to the `codelinter_languages` dictionary. By default, the dictionary is empty, so
no code blocks will be processed unless added.

For example, to pass all JSON blocks to Python's built-in JSON module, use:

```python
codelinter_languages = {
  "json": "python -m json.tool"
}
```

The Python command `python -m json.tool` returns an error for non-valid JSON code. To
lint YAML code blocks, install the `yamllint` tool and add:

```python
codelinter_languages = {
  "yaml": "yamllint -"
}
```

The `-` tells yamllint to read from `stdin`. You can write your own tools that read from
`stdin` and write to `stdout` or `stderr`. They should return `0` if no errors are
found, a non-zero value otherwise.

You can use any reStructuredText directive that gets parsed as a `literal_block` node.
For example, you can use `.. code-block:: json`, `.. code:: json`, or
`..literalinclude:: <filename>` to include code from files.

```rst
.. literalinclude:: code.json
   :language: json
```

> **Caution:** The command you add to the `codelinter_languages` dictionary is called as
> provided. No additional safe-guards are in place to prevent abuse.

## Use

The **awesome codelinter** extension runs as a Sphinx builder. Run
`sphinx-build -b codelinter` to check your code blocks. If the codelinter tool returns a
non-zero value, a warning is logged. To turn warnings into errors and stop the build
process, use `sphinx-build -W`.
